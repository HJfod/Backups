# Backups

## <cr>This mod does NOT save to the cloud!</c> To back up your data to the cloud, use the game's built-in Save / Load feature. <cy>This mod only makes local backups!</c>

Makes <cy>automatic backups</c> of your savefiles at a configurable rate, making sure you never lose your progress again!

You can also <cp>import existing local backups</c>! The date of the backup is inferred from the file modification date.

Because save files also store the logged in user, <cj>this mod can also be used as a Profile Switcher</c> :)
