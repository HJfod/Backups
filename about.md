# Backups

Makes <cy>automatic backups</c> of your savefiles at a configurable rate, making sure you never lose your progress again!

Note that this mod <cr>only makes local backups!</c> <cj>To back up your data to the cloud, use the game's built-in Save / Load feature</c>.

You can also <cp>import existing local backups</c>! The date of the backup is inferred from the file modification date.

Because save files also store the logged in user, <cj>this mod can also be used as a Profile Switcher</c> :)
